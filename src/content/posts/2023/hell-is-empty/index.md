De la Wikipedia:

> Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of interpersonal relationship instability, a distorted sense of self and intense emotional responses. Individuals diagnosed with BPD frequently exhibit self-harming behaviours and engage in risky activities, primarily due to challenges in regulating emotional states to a healthy, stable baseline. Symptoms such as dissociation (a feeling of detachment from reality), a pervasive sense of emptiness and an acute fear of abandonment are prevalent among those affected.<p>
BPD is associated with a substantial risk of suicide; an estimated at 8 to 10 percent of individuals with BPD die by suicide, with males affected at twice the rate of females.<p>
The causes of BPD are unclear and complex, implicating genetic, neurological, and psychosocial conditions in its development. BPD is commonly confused with a mood disorder.

> Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder characterized by periods of depression and periods of abnormally elevated mood that each last from days to weeks. If the elevated mood is severe or associated with psychosis, it is called mania; if it is less severe and does not significantly affect functioning, it is called hypomania. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy or irritable, and they often make impulsive decisions with little regard for the consequences. There is usually also a reduced need for sleep during manic phases. During periods of depression, the individual may experience crying and have a negative outlook on life and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide is high; over a period of 20 years, 6% of those with bipolar disorder died by suicide, while 30â€“40% engaged in self-harm.<p>
While the causes of this mood disorder are not clearly understood, both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role.
