Cognitive bias	Short description
Confirmation bias	The tendency to selectively search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions or hypotheses
Conjunction fallacy	The tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one
Endowment effect	The tendency that people often demand more to give up on an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it
Fundamental attribution error	The tendency to overemphasize personal factors and underestimate situational factors when explaining other people's behavior
Gambler's fallacy	The tendency to think that future probabilities are changed by past events, when in reality they are unchanged (e.g., series of roulette wheel spins)
Halo effect	The tendency for a person's positive or negative traits to extend from one area of their personality to another in others' perceptions of them
Hindsight bias*	A memory distortion phenomenon by which with the benefit of feedback about the outcome of an event, people's recalled judgments of the likelihood of that event are typically closer to the actual outcome than their original judgments were
Hot-hand fallacy*	The expectation of streaks in sequences of hits and misses whose probabilities are, in fact, independent (e.g., coin tosses, basketball shots)
Illusory correlation	The tendency to identify a correlation between a certain type of action and effect when no such correlation exists
In-group bias	The tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own group
