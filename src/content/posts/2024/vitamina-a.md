Seguramente muchos os hagáis la siguiente pregunta:

> Profesor Ensaladín, si me da un venazo y me meto 8 kilos de zanahorias entre pecho y espalda, **¿podré ver en la oscuridad como los gatos, las lechuzas o Batman?**

Efectivamente **no**.

Hecha esta puntualización, vayamos al trapo.


## Fuentes

- Es una vitamina liposoluble (no se disuelve en agua y se puede almacenar).
- El cuerpo humano no puede producir vitamina A.
- Se obtiene de alimentos de origen animal (**retinol** y derivados como el ácido trans-retinoico, ATRA) y de origen vegetal en forma de **provitamina A** (**carotenoides**).
- Los carotenoides se deben transformar en retinol, pero **no todos los carotenoides son provitamina A**; de los más de 50 que **sí** lo son, en la dieta humana se reducen a tres: **alfa-carotenos, beta-carotenos y beta-criptoxantina**.
- La principal fuente de carotenoides son frutas y hortalizas de coloración amarilla-naranja (zanahoria, tomate, mango, melocotón, melón, naranja, mandarina), y verduras de hoja verde oscura (espinaca, brócoli).
- La mayoría de los carotenoides sobreviven el cocinado, siendo la fritura el método que más negativamente les afecta.
- En los animales la mayor fuente de vitamina A es el hígado, seguido de lácteos, carne, huevos y pescado.
- El higado con más contenido en vitamina A es el del cerdo.
- La leche con más grasa contiene más retinol.


The amount of vitamin A is significantly dependent on the amount of β-carotene contained in the feed or food supplements with preformed vitamin or β-carotene given to the animals. Large differences can be observed, for example, in cows fed a diet based mainly on grains or that are grass-fed

The content of vitamin A is significantly lower in other animal organs, and it reaches only units up to tens of micrograms per 100 g in meat [58,61]. The same is true for both freshwater and sea fish. Their livers also contain units up to tens of milligrams of vitamin A per 100 g (some tropical fish even up to hundreds), while their muscles contain only tens of micrograms per 100 g. As with other animals, the highest vitamin A levels are found in the livers of the top predators, i.e., carnivorous fish. One of the most important sources of vitamin A is the liver oil of various marine species, including sharks.

Chicken egg yolks can contain up to almost one milligram of vitamin A per 100 mg.

## Absorción

Absorption differs significantly between animal vitamin A (retinol and its derivatives) and carotenoids [1,71]. The retinyl esters found in animal-origin foods are almost completely absorbed, while carotenoid absorption is significantly lower.

Its absorption is increased if consumed with fatty meals since micelle formation supports the absorption of fat-soluble compounds, such as animal vitamin A in the small intestine [71]. In addition to fat, some micronutrients, such as zinc, are also needed for the absorption of the vitamin [73]. 

When carotene intake is high, there is only a small conversion rate, and most of the carotene is stored in the adipose tissue and other fat reserves.

Not all retinol in the hepatocytes is secreted with RBP. Some retinol is transported to the stellate cells of the liver, where it is metabolized into retinyl esters and forms the main storage of vitamin A in the body [93,105]. In general, vitamin A is stored in the form of retinyl esters [106]. In addition, adipose tissue and other organs can store retinoids. Examples include the testes, adrenal glands, lungs, kidneys and interstitial cells. This storage ability is important for organs with a high vitamin A requirement, especially retinal epithelium. In cases of a vitamin A-deficient diet, physiological levels can be maintained for several months thanks to these stored reserves. When needed, these storage organs release retinoids into the blood.

Alcohol consumption is an important factor mediating the inhibition of vitamin A metabolism.

β-Carotene is an important dietary source of vitamin A for humans. However, the bioavailability and vitamin A equivalency of β-carotene are highly variable and can be affected by food- and diet-related factors, including the food matrix, food-processing techniques, size of the dose of β-carotene, and the amounts of dietary fat, fiber, vitamin A, and other carotenoids in the diet as well as by characteristics of the target population, such as vitamin A status, nutrient deficiencies, gut integrity, and genetic polymorphisms associated with β-carotene metabolism. The absorption of β-carotene from plant sources ranges from 5% to 65% in humans. Vitamin A equivalency ratios for β-carotene to vitamin A from plant sources range from 3.8:1 to 28:1, by weight. 

Provitamin A carotenoids are an important source of dietary vitamin A that are found primarily in dark-green leafy vegetables (DGLVs), such as spinach, and in orange and yellow vegetables and fruit, such as carrot, mango, and papaya. Provitamin A carotenoids provide ≤30% of daily vitamin A intake in the United States, whereas animal products that contain preformed vitamin A, such as dairy products, egg yolk, and liver, provide ≥70% of daily vitamin A intake (1). In contrast, in low-income populations in developing countries, dietary carotenoids provide ∼80% of daily vitamin A intake (2). This is an important difference because preformed dietary vitamin A is well absorbed by humans, whereas provitamin A carotenoids from plant sources are less well absorbed and need to be converted to vitamin A in human intestinal cells (3). Of the provitamin A carotenoids commonly found in foods, β-carotene has the greatest vitamin A activity (3). The other provitamin A carotenoids are assumed to have approximately half the vitamin A activity of β-carotene, although recent data suggest that the bioavailability of β-cryptoxanthin and α-carotene is greater than previously assumed (4). The vitamin A equivalency ratio for β-carotene to vitamin A is currently estimated as 12:1, by weight (12 μg β-carotene is equal to 1 μg retinol), for plant sources of β-carotene in a mixed diet

FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF β-CAROTENE

Food- and diet-related factors that affect the bioavailability of β-carotene include the food matrix, food-preparation techniques, size of the dose of β-carotene, and the amounts of fat, fiber, preformed vitamin A, or other carotenoids in the diet (3, 16, 19, 20). The bioavailability of β-carotene tends to be lower in foods with complex foods matrices, such as DGLVs, and higher in foods with simpler foods matrices, such as fruit and red palm oil (19). β-Carotene must be released from the food matrix to be absorbed, and food-processing techniques that disrupt the food matrix such as mild cooking and homogenization increase the bioavailability of β-carotene

The amount of fat that is required for optimal absorption of β-carotene has been reported to range from 2.4 to 5 g/meal for cooked vegetables.

 Larger amounts of dietary fat may be required for optimal absorption of β-carotene from raw vegetables than from cooked vegetables because the food matrix of uncooked vegetables may reduce bioavailability to a greater extent. In contrast, sucrose polyester, a nonabsorbable fat found in some processed foods, has been shown to reduce the plasma β-carotene response by 21% (29). Water-soluble dietary fibers can also affect β-carotene bioavailability; pectin, guar, and alginates reduced absorption of carotenoids by ∼33–43%


 Intestinal conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A is affected by vitamin A status.  Recently, vitamin A deficiency has been shown to induce BCMO1 (β,β-carotene 15,15′-monooxygenase 1) expression, which is the key enzyme that converts β-carotene to vitamin A in intestinal cells 
 Animal studies suggest that nutritional deficiencies of iron, zinc, and protein may also affect estimates of the vitamin A equivalency of β-carotene. 

Iron deficiency disrupts retinol homeostasis and results in decreased mobilization of vitamin A from the liver and low serum retinol concentrations in rats (36). Marginal zinc deficiency results in a significant reduction in β-carotene absorption in rats (37)

The absorption of pure β-carotene has been reported to range from 8.7% to 65% in humans
The absorption of β-carotene from plant sources has been reported to range from ∼7% to 65% in humans
β-Carotene absorption from mixed diets in adults was reported to range from 11.9% to 16% (51, 52, 54). The absorption of β-carotene from specific foods was reported to range from ∼5% to 26% for spinach (55, 56) and from ∼7% to 65% for carrots (53, 57) and was 12% for broccoli 

Within studies, β-carotene tended to be better absorbed from foods that were more highly processed. Absorption was significantly greater from liquefied spinach than from whole leaf spinach (55), and significantly greater from cooked carrots than from raw carrots
The vitamin A equivalency of pure β-carotene in oil has been reported to range from 2:1 to 55:1, by weight, in humans
Vitamin A equivalency ratios for plant β-carotene range from 3.8:1 to 28:1 in humans


## Eliminación

The elimination of retinoids happens through the kidneys or via the liver into bile [110]. The evacuation of stored retinoids formed in the body is slower than water-soluble vitamins due to their being stored in different organs. After intake interruption, months can go by before noticing any vitamin A deficiency.

## Funciones

A summary of the wide range of physiological processes in which retinoids are involved is provided in Figure 4. These processes include vision in darkness, corneal and conjunctiva development, cellular growth and differentiation, immune system functioning, bone and fetus development and central nervous system (CNS) formation. Carotenoids also act as antioxidants

Interestingly, retinoids have been reported to also be involved in several pathological situations: 

### Visión
In the eye, the retina is the structure responsible for visual perception, including its transmission to the brain. This perception is mediated by specific structures in the retina: rods and cones. Rods are sensitive to low light and hence are crucial for vision in dark situations (e.g., night vision), whereas cones are responsible for high-intensity light (color vision). The active vitamin A derivate is 11-cis-retinal in this case. It is associated with the protein opsin, a G-coupled protein receptor in the retina. The complex is known as rhodopsin, which is the crucial pigment for light perception [140,141]. Upon light stimuli, 11-cis-retinal is transformed into all-trans-retinal and initiates a chain of reactions whose ultimate consequence is transmitting optic perceptions via the optic nerve to the brain 
A deficiency in retinol leads to low light vision impairment due to deficient rhodopsin formation. This situation causes night blindness, which is also called nyctalopia [144]. Low light vision can be recovered after the normalization of plasma retinol levels. However, it takes several weeks until the normal function is completely restored.

### Receptores nucleares
The role of ATRA in NR interaction is the most frequently studied mechanism after the visual role of vitamin A. The genetic effects triggered by interactions between ATRA and its receptors are directly involved in multiple physiological functions: cellular differentiation, tissue development, tissue regeneration, cellular apoptosis, etc.

### Sistema inmune
The adaptative immune system is another process in which vitamin A plays a key role. The vitamin acts as a cofactor in the proliferation and differentiation of regulatory T cells and several immune functions through indirect processes.
The immune system’s response to infections, such as measles and parasitic infections, is compromised in vitamin A deficiency, and the severity and length of these conditions are prolonged if the levels of vitamin A are not quickly restored.

### Mucosa intestinal
Vitamin A is also involved in mucin synthesis by the goblet cells in the intestine [215]. An early study performed in chickens determined that goblet replacement rate and, therefore, mucin formation decreases in vitamin A deficiency.
In wounded tissues, retinoids promote epidermal turnover and normal tissue restoration. ATRA mediates these functions by promoting the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin and the proliferation of keratinocytes, supporting the rapid restoration of a normal epidermis [225]. In retinoid deficiency, normal epithelium recovery is impaired, and the process needs a longer time to occur.

### Otras funciones
Through NR activation, retinoids are involved in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The activation of RAR and PPAR regulates genes that are directly involved in glucose transport, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis and adipocyte differentiation [178,226,227]. Elevated RBP levels in the blood have been linked with insulin resistance [228]. Contrarily, retinal has been reported to improve metabolic syndrome by preventing adipose tissue generation, playing a direct role in obesity

Since the levels of vitamin A circulating throughout the body are higher than the amount of vitamin needed for vision and the already reported genetic functions, it is understandable to suggest that retinoids can be involved in additional biological processes. In the second half of the last century, a decreased activity of several enzymes was observed in vitamin A deficiency, indicating that retinoids can act as cofactors in some enzymatic reactions [215,243,244]. These non-genomic activities of retinoids explain many of their activities, such as the effects observed at the dermatological level [245].

Vitamin A participates in reduction–oxidation homeostasis [247,248]. Carotenoids, as reported above, are well-known antioxidants [253,254]. However, research has indicated that in excess, carotenoids may have pro-oxidant effects as well [255,256].

Retinoids also play a role in bone homeostasis [265,266]. Elevated levels of retinoids have been described to have undesirable effects in bones in experimental animals by promoting their fragility and thinning [267,268]. However, decreased levels of vitamin A have deleterious effects on bone metabolism as well [269]. On the other hand, carotenoids have been reported to contribute to correct bone formation via their antioxidant properties. However, such effects are not related to the physiological function of vitamin A [265]. In addition, crosstalk between vitamins has been described regarding bone metabolism, which is understandable, mainly among the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Several examples confirm this finding, e.g., (1) Vitamin A has been reported to prevent vitamin D and E absorption in in vitro models [270], (2). Although it is well-known that decreased vitamin D promotes bone fragility, this effect has been reported to be worsened in individuals also presenting a high intake of vitamin A [271,272,273] and similarly, high vitamin A levels decrease calcium absorption by mediating the vitamin D-calcium response [274,275], (3). A high vitamin A intake has been proposed to decrease vitamin D toxicity and toxic effects on bone metabolism [276], (4). In addition, vitamin D deficiency and a high blood concentration of vitamin A have been linked with bone fragility [272], (5). A potential synergetic effect between both vitamins causing apoptosis in cancer cells and preventing lung cancer development, has also been suggested [277,278]. Therefore, vitamin A levels in the body may have consequences regarding the metabolism of other vitamins or in the effects produced by them.


## Deficiencia 

¿Qué tienen en común la vitamina A y las pajas? Las dos te pueden dejar ciego, y aunque es cierto que la segunda no está científicamente demostrada, no es menos cierto que Dios te mira.

The most characteristic consequence of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision. Early sight impairment is significant, especially under conditions of reduced light. In extreme cases, due to long-term vitamin A deficiency, the conjunctival and corneal epithelium losses their differentiation ability, leading to hyperkeratinization of the ocular epithelial tissue (xeropthalmia), and eventually, total blindness, which can be permanent. This circumstance is the most common cause of blindness in developing countries 

Epithelial modifications due to vitamin A deficiency directly affect several systems in the human body and cause weight loss. In the respiratory system, changes in the bronchorespiratory epithelium occur, and the tissue is more prone to infections. Skin can keratinize, and the epidermis dries out with the subsequent appearance of papular eruptions and keratinization of sweat glands.

In the gastrointestinal tract, there is a reduction of the number of goblet cells in the intestines, epithelial alteration, and pancreatic ductal epithelium metaplasia. Nerve lesions have also been reported. Taste and smell functions are also partially mediated by vitamin A through the mediation of mucopolysaccharides synthesis, which are responsible for taste sensing [327], and the keratinization of this tissue leads to a loss of the sense [328,329,330]. In addition to a higher frequency of airway infections due to an impaired epithelium, general susceptibility to infection and inflammation are other symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.

Vitamin A is also known to interfere with iron metabolism. Therefore, vitamin A deficiency can cause anemia. 

An insufficient intake of vitamin A and carotenoids through the diet is the primary cause of the deficiency. It is typically present in developing countries. 

Vitamin A deficiency is more prevalent worldwide than retinoid intoxication

Vitamin A deficiency is still a leading cause of preventable childhood blindness and is associated with reduced immune function and increased risk of mortality from gastrointestinal disease and measles (7, 8).

## Toxicidad

Vitamin A toxicity is a rather rare condition, but it can happen due to an enhanced intake of vitamin A or even after retinoid administration for therapeutic purposes.

Carotenoids are considered safe compounds. Significant toxicity is very rare. In cases of excessive carotenoid intake, orange/yellowish skin coloration appears (carotenoderma or carotenemia). These symptoms are fully reversible; they disappear with time after the discontinuation of carotenoid intake.

Dietary β-carotene is a safe source of vitamin A because intestinal conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A decreases as an oral dose of β-carotene increases (9). In contrast, preformed dietary vitamin A is well absorbed in humans and has been associated with adverse effects on health, if consumed in high amounts. Diets high in preformed vitamin A were associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women, whereas dietary β-carotene intake was not
