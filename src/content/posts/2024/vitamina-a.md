Seguramente muchos os hagáis la siguiente pregunta:

> Si como 12 toneladas de vitamina A, **¿podré ver en la oscuridad como gatos, lechuzas o Batman?**

Efectivamente no.

Y ahora que hemos reducido las expectativas a la nada, empecemos.


## Fuentes

- Es una vitamina liposoluble, por lo tanto se puede almacenar.
- El cuerpo humano no puede producirla.
- Se obtiene de alimentos de origen animal (**retinoides**) y de origen vegetal en forma de **provitamina A** (**carotenoides**).

- El retinol es una de las tres formas de la vitamina A, junto con el retinal y el ácido retinoico (ATRA). Estos 3 ingredientes forman parte de la familia de los retinoides (su nombre viene de retina, ya que fue ahi donde se aisló por primera vez).
- En los animales la mayor fuente de vitamina A es con gran diferencia el hígado, seguido de lácteos, carne, huevos y pescado.
- La leche con más grasa tiene más retinol.
- La cantidad de vitamina A en alimentos de origen animal depende de la cantidad de beta-carotenos (o suplementos) consumidos por esos animales. Por ejemplo, las vacas de pasto tienen más vitamina A que las alimentadas con cereales.

- Los carotenoides se deben transformar en retinol, pero **no todos los carotenoides son provitamina A**; de los más de 50 que **sí** lo son, en la dieta humana se reducen a tres: **alfa-carotenos**, **beta-carotenos** y **beta-criptoxantina**, siendo los beta-carotenos los que más vitamina A aportan.
- La principal fuente de carotenoides son frutas y hortalizas de coloración amarilla-naranja (zanahoria, tomate, mango, melocotón, melón, naranja, mandarina), y verduras de hoja verde oscura (espinaca, brócoli).


## Absorción

- Su absorción a partir de retinoides (origen animal) es casi del 100%. La de los carotenoides varia entre el 5 y el 65%.
- Los carotenoides sobreviven mayormente al cocinado, siendo la fritura el método menos recomendable.
- A mayor complejidad de la matriz alimentaria de un alimento, menor biodisponiblidad de beta-carotenos. Las verduras de hoja verde son más complejas que las frutas. El cocinado (ligero) aumenta la biodisponibilidad al descomponer la matriz.
- Consumirlos junto con grasa aumenta su índice de absorción. Se necesita más grasa cuando se consumen crudos por la mayor complejidad de la matriz.
- La fibra soluble reduce la biodisponibilidad de carotenoides en un 30-40%.
- La deficiencia de zinc, hierro y proteina afecta a su absorción.
- A medida que aumenta la dosis de carotenos se reduce el índice de absorción.
- Se almacena principalmente en el hígado como ésteres de retinilo, la forma inactiva del retinol. Otros órganos como los pulmones, los riñones o el tejido adiposo (grasa) también pueden almacenarlo.
- Como consecuencia del punto anterior, la deficiencia de vitamina A se detecta tras varios meses.
- El alcohol inhibe su metabolismo.


## Eliminación

The elimination of retinoids happens through the kidneys or via the liver into bile [110]. The evacuation of stored retinoids formed in the body is slower than water-soluble vitamins due to their being stored in different organs. After intake interruption, months can go by before noticing any vitamin A deficiency.

## Funciones

A summary of the wide range of physiological processes in which retinoids are involved is provided in Figure 4. These processes include vision in darkness, corneal and conjunctiva development, cellular growth and differentiation, immune system functioning, bone and fetus development and central nervous system (CNS) formation. Carotenoids also act as antioxidants

Interestingly, retinoids have been reported to also be involved in several pathological situations: 

### Visión
In the eye, the retina is the structure responsible for visual perception, including its transmission to the brain. This perception is mediated by specific structures in the retina: rods and cones. Rods are sensitive to low light and hence are crucial for vision in dark situations (e.g., night vision), whereas cones are responsible for high-intensity light (color vision). The active vitamin A derivate is 11-cis-retinal in this case. It is associated with the protein opsin, a G-coupled protein receptor in the retina. The complex is known as rhodopsin, which is the crucial pigment for light perception [140,141]. Upon light stimuli, 11-cis-retinal is transformed into all-trans-retinal and initiates a chain of reactions whose ultimate consequence is transmitting optic perceptions via the optic nerve to the brain 
A deficiency in retinol leads to low light vision impairment due to deficient rhodopsin formation. This situation causes night blindness, which is also called nyctalopia [144]. Low light vision can be recovered after the normalization of plasma retinol levels. However, it takes several weeks until the normal function is completely restored.

### Receptores nucleares
The role of ATRA in NR interaction is the most frequently studied mechanism after the visual role of vitamin A. The genetic effects triggered by interactions between ATRA and its receptors are directly involved in multiple physiological functions: cellular differentiation, tissue development, tissue regeneration, cellular apoptosis, etc.

### Sistema inmune
The adaptative immune system is another process in which vitamin A plays a key role. The vitamin acts as a cofactor in the proliferation and differentiation of regulatory T cells and several immune functions through indirect processes.
The immune system’s response to infections, such as measles and parasitic infections, is compromised in vitamin A deficiency, and the severity and length of these conditions are prolonged if the levels of vitamin A are not quickly restored.

### Mucosa intestinal
Vitamin A is also involved in mucin synthesis by the goblet cells in the intestine [215]. An early study performed in chickens determined that goblet replacement rate and, therefore, mucin formation decreases in vitamin A deficiency.
In wounded tissues, retinoids promote epidermal turnover and normal tissue restoration. ATRA mediates these functions by promoting the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin and the proliferation of keratinocytes, supporting the rapid restoration of a normal epidermis [225]. In retinoid deficiency, normal epithelium recovery is impaired, and the process needs a longer time to occur.

### Otras funciones
Through NR activation, retinoids are involved in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The activation of RAR and PPAR regulates genes that are directly involved in glucose transport, fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis and adipocyte differentiation [178,226,227]. Elevated RBP levels in the blood have been linked with insulin resistance [228]. Contrarily, retinal has been reported to improve metabolic syndrome by preventing adipose tissue generation, playing a direct role in obesity

Since the levels of vitamin A circulating throughout the body are higher than the amount of vitamin needed for vision and the already reported genetic functions, it is understandable to suggest that retinoids can be involved in additional biological processes. In the second half of the last century, a decreased activity of several enzymes was observed in vitamin A deficiency, indicating that retinoids can act as cofactors in some enzymatic reactions [215,243,244]. These non-genomic activities of retinoids explain many of their activities, such as the effects observed at the dermatological level [245].

Vitamin A participates in reduction–oxidation homeostasis [247,248]. Carotenoids, as reported above, are well-known antioxidants [253,254]. However, research has indicated that in excess, carotenoids may have pro-oxidant effects as well [255,256].

Retinoids also play a role in bone homeostasis [265,266]. Elevated levels of retinoids have been described to have undesirable effects in bones in experimental animals by promoting their fragility and thinning [267,268]. However, decreased levels of vitamin A have deleterious effects on bone metabolism as well [269]. On the other hand, carotenoids have been reported to contribute to correct bone formation via their antioxidant properties. However, such effects are not related to the physiological function of vitamin A [265]. In addition, crosstalk between vitamins has been described regarding bone metabolism, which is understandable, mainly among the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Several examples confirm this finding, e.g., (1) Vitamin A has been reported to prevent vitamin D and E absorption in in vitro models [270], (2). Although it is well-known that decreased vitamin D promotes bone fragility, this effect has been reported to be worsened in individuals also presenting a high intake of vitamin A [271,272,273] and similarly, high vitamin A levels decrease calcium absorption by mediating the vitamin D-calcium response [274,275], (3). A high vitamin A intake has been proposed to decrease vitamin D toxicity and toxic effects on bone metabolism [276], (4). In addition, vitamin D deficiency and a high blood concentration of vitamin A have been linked with bone fragility [272], (5). A potential synergetic effect between both vitamins causing apoptosis in cancer cells and preventing lung cancer development, has also been suggested [277,278]. Therefore, vitamin A levels in the body may have consequences regarding the metabolism of other vitamins or in the effects produced by them.


## Deficiencia 

¿Qué tienen en común la vitamina A y las pajas? Las dos te pueden dejar ciego, y aunque es cierto que la segunda no está científicamente demostrada, no es menos cierto que Dios te mira.

The most characteristic consequence of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision. Early sight impairment is significant, especially under conditions of reduced light. In extreme cases, due to long-term vitamin A deficiency, the conjunctival and corneal epithelium losses their differentiation ability, leading to hyperkeratinization of the ocular epithelial tissue (xeropthalmia), and eventually, total blindness, which can be permanent. This circumstance is the most common cause of blindness in developing countries 

Epithelial modifications due to vitamin A deficiency directly affect several systems in the human body and cause weight loss. In the respiratory system, changes in the bronchorespiratory epithelium occur, and the tissue is more prone to infections. Skin can keratinize, and the epidermis dries out with the subsequent appearance of papular eruptions and keratinization of sweat glands.

In the gastrointestinal tract, there is a reduction of the number of goblet cells in the intestines, epithelial alteration, and pancreatic ductal epithelium metaplasia. Nerve lesions have also been reported. Taste and smell functions are also partially mediated by vitamin A through the mediation of mucopolysaccharides synthesis, which are responsible for taste sensing [327], and the keratinization of this tissue leads to a loss of the sense [328,329,330]. In addition to a higher frequency of airway infections due to an impaired epithelium, general susceptibility to infection and inflammation are other symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.

Vitamin A is also known to interfere with iron metabolism. Therefore, vitamin A deficiency can cause anemia. 

An insufficient intake of vitamin A and carotenoids through the diet is the primary cause of the deficiency. It is typically present in developing countries. 

Vitamin A deficiency is more prevalent worldwide than retinoid intoxication

Vitamin A deficiency is still a leading cause of preventable childhood blindness and is associated with reduced immune function and increased risk of mortality from gastrointestinal disease and measles (7, 8).

## Toxicidad

Vitamin A toxicity is a rather rare condition, but it can happen due to an enhanced intake of vitamin A or even after retinoid administration for therapeutic purposes.

Carotenoids are considered safe compounds. Significant toxicity is very rare. In cases of excessive carotenoid intake, orange/yellowish skin coloration appears (carotenoderma or carotenemia). These symptoms are fully reversible; they disappear with time after the discontinuation of carotenoid intake.

Dietary β-carotene is a safe source of vitamin A because intestinal conversion of β-carotene to vitamin A decreases as an oral dose of β-carotene increases (9). In contrast, preformed dietary vitamin A is well absorbed in humans and has been associated with adverse effects on health, if consumed in high amounts. Diets high in preformed vitamin A were associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women, whereas dietary β-carotene intake was not
