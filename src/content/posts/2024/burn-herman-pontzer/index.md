Hay un montón de libros sobre nutrición pero la gran mayoría caen en uno de estos dos grupos:

- Autores con una agenda personal u obsesión por una dieta en particular (vegana, cetogénica, paleo, etc.) que tuercen los estudios hasta que encajan con su verdad ([sesgo de confirmación](../sesgos-y-falacias/#sesgo-de-confirmaci%C3%B3n)).
- Manuales muy básicos de *influencers/instagramers* o divulgadores para las masas, en algunos casos con el agravante de títulos tipo *"Pierda un porrón de kilos en x días"*.

Es difícil encontrar libros que traten el estado actual de la ciencia nutricional con un poco de detalle, gracia y rigor sin caer en lo banal o en el ensayo académico, y creo que este libro encuentra un buen equilibrio: detallado pero no excesivamente denso, bien redactado, con un punto de humor y con información de primera mano, ya que el autor, entre otras historias, convivió con los Hadza, una de las últimas tribus cazadoras-recolectoras, para estudiar el metabolismo energético humano.

Por todo ello recomiendo este libro a todo aquel que quiera aprender como funciona su cuerpo y no esté casado con ninguna dieta ni necesite justificar fanáticamente sus decisiones nutricionales.

Adjunto un fragmento para indecisos (en inglés, pero el libro está traducido y editado en castellano).

> Even terrible diets can lead to weight loss and improvement in metabolic health, as long as they reduce calorie intake. So-called monotrophic diets, in which you eat only one food, often lead to weight loss because people get tired of eating the same thing over and over again, and end up eating less. The potato diet is a popular example. The magician Penn Jillette reportedly lost more than a hundred pounds eating only potatoes (which, it’s worth pointing out, are full of starchy carbohydrates). Mark Haub, a professor at Kansas State University, followed a junk food diet for ten weeks to make the point that calories are all that really matter for weight, and tracked his progress on Facebook for the world to see. He ate a Twinkie every three hours instead of normal meals, and rounded out the diet with chips, sugar-rich cereal, and cookies. The diet sounds like a health disaster (and I’m not recommending it!), but the key piece of the puzzle was the calories: Haub limited himself to 1,800 kcal per day, well below his daily energy expenditure. At the end of ten weeks, he had lost twenty-seven pounds, went from an “overweight” BMI of 28.8 to a “normal” 24.9, and lowered his cholesterol and triglycerides.


> Faced with calorie restriction, our hypothalamus reduces our metabolic rate and cranks up our drive to eat. When excess calories come pouring in, metabolic rates go up, burning off much of the excess intake. Think for a moment about what that means for your organs and all of their various tasks: when energy is scarce, some nonessential metabolic processes are suppressed; when times are good, some nonessential metabolic processes are promoted.<p/>
It should come as no surprise that humans and other animals, as the inheritors of half a billion years of vertebrate evolution, are very clever about which tasks are sacrificed when things get tough and which ones are protected. My favorite example comes from the mouse study out of John Speakman’s lab that I mentioned in Chapter 5. His team subjected adult male mice to different degrees of calorie restriction and measured how their bodies responded as their energy deficit became more and more dire. Metabolic rates and body mass plummeted as expected, but the effects were unevenly distributed across the body. Most organs, like the heart, lungs, and liver, shrank (and burned less energy) as the mice lost weight. Brains were protected, maintaining their size. The stomach and intestines actually grew, in a costly effort to squeeze every last calorie from their food. The best comparison, though, is between the spleen and testes. The spleen, a major organ in the immune system, melted away immediately, shrinking more than other organs. Testes, on the other hand, were protected, changing very little until the energy deficit was truly desperate. I love the study because it lays bare the evolved metabolic strategy of mice: Life is short. Make babies. The immune system is optional.<p/>
In a long-lived species like us, the evolved metabolic strategy is different. Sam Urlacher’s work with Shuar kids has shown that children fighting an infection increase the energy spent on immune defense while reducing their growth. Apparently, when times get tough, humans play the long game, allocating energy to maintenance and survival.
