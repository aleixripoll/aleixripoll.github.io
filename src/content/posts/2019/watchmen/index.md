Edward Blake, The Comedian, born 1918, buried in the rain. Murdered. Is that what happens to us? No time for friends? Only our enemies leave roses. Violent lives ending violently. Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. Blake saw society's true face. Chose to be a parody of it, a joke.

I heard a joke once. Man goes to doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Doctor says *"Treatment is simple. The great clown, Pagliacci, is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up"*. Man bursts into tears. *"But doctor"*, he says, *"I am Pagliacci."*

Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.
