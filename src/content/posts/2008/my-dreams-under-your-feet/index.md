Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,\
Enwrought with golden and silver light,\
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths\
Of night and light and the half light,\
I would spread the cloths under your feet:\
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;\
I have spread my dreams under your feet;\
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
