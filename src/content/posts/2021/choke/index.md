> You gain power by pretending to be weak. By contrast, you make people feel so strong. You save people by letting them save you.


> What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me.
